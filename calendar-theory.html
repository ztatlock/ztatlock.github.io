<p>Meetings are for
technical progress and
project planning.
On the technical side,
we work together to
chip away at tough problems,
help everyone get unstuck, and
figure out immediate next steps.
On the planning side,
we set bigger goals,
track progress, and
adapt as we learn.</p>
<p>We will only meet when we have
a plan and concrete goals,
otherwise we can just
hang out in the lab.
We will end meetings early
if we can accomplish our goals quickly,
or cancel them outright
if they do not have a good plan
<a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/product/dbm/">📕</a>.
Doing so provides more time
to work in the lab together and
just enjoy life.</p>
<p>Toward these goals,
we will collectively
maintain regular meeting
<a href="#cadence">cadence</a> and
<a href="#structure">structure</a>.</p>
<section id="cadence">
<h2>Regular Meeting Cadence</h2>
<p>The beginning of the week is <em>tactical</em>,
focusing concretely on what we want to
accomplish in the next few days.
The end of the week is <em>strategic</em>,
reflecting on progress and
how we should adjust plans.</p>

<section id="Mondays">
<h3>Mondays</h3>
<p>Mondays are for <em>all</em> project meetings.
Every student should go to one project meeting<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
It is better to do one project exceedingly well
rather than several projects at a mediocre level.
Requiring all project meetings to be on Mondays
also serves as a sort of “budget” or limiting factor
to ensure that I can regularly invest
good hours helping on your project
by avoiding overcommitment;
please hold me accountable
if you see me violating this rule.</p>
</section>
<section id="Tuesdays">
<h3>Tuesdays</h3>
<p>On Tuesdays
I will work in the lab.
I hope you will join me!
Historically,
working together in the lab is
where the best meetings happen
because they are motivated by
an immediate problem that we
can quickly chip away at together.
If you see me in the lab,
I am there to collaborate,
so don’t hesitate to “interrupt” me;
that’s why I am there.</p>
<p>During the school year, we will have
group lunch at 12:00 in the PLSE Lab (<a href="https://norfolk.cs.washington.edu/directory/?search_string=gc253">Gates 253</a>)
with research presentations starting at 12:30.
To the extent possible, all our
exams, practice talks, and visitor presentations
should be scheduled on Tuesdays as a PLSE Talk.
However, my favorite PLSE Talks are
work-in-progress discussions and
live demos of prototype tools where
everyone in the lab can help brainstorm.</p>
<p>Tuesdays afternoons are also available
for quick one-off meetings,
just message me.</p>
</section>
<section id="Wednesdays">
<h3>Wednesdays</h3>
<p>Wednesdays are for doing big things.
Avoid scheduling any recurring meetings on Wednesdays.
Coordinating our “no meetings day”
helps everyone have enough time
to do deep, technical work.
Wednesdays are a good time to (on demand)
find a conference room and
actively pair program / write / prove
with your team for a couple hours.</p>
<p>If for some reason we cannot schedule an
exam or practice talk during
a Tuesday PLSE Talk slot,
then Wednesday afternoon is an
acceptable (though not ideal!)
backup option.</p>
</section>
<section id="Thursdays">
<h3>Thursdays</h3>
<p>On Thursdays
I will work in the lab.
I hope you will join me!
Historically,
working together in the lab is
where the best meetings happen
because they are motivated by
an immediate problem that we
can quickly chip away at together.
If you see me in the lab,

so don’t hesitate to “interrupt” me;
that’s why I am there.</p>
<p>The Allen School Colloquium
will be at 15:30.
Please participate!
In Autumn,
colloquium will be a mix of
distinguished lectures and
talks from labs across the Allen School.
In Winter and Spring,
colloquium will mostly consist of
faculty candidate talks.
These talks survey
what’s going on across the
broader computing landscape.
Even better,
they are a great opportunity to
observe what works (or doesn’t)
when giving presentations.</p>
<p>Thursday afternoons may also be OK
for quick one-off meetings.
Again, just message me.</p>
</section>
<section id="Fridays">
<h3>Fridays</h3>
<p>Fridays are for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>30 minute one-on-one PhD student meetings with me in the morning</p>
<ul>
<li>
You should also have an end-of-week meeting with any students you mentor!
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning our goal for Monday’s upcoming project meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 minute team-wide progress meeting at 15:00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60 minute PL Reading Group at 15:30</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After our one-on-one,
you should prepare an agenda for
our upcoming project meeting on Monday.
See below for some ideas on
what makes for a good agenda.</p>
<p>At 15:00 we will have a 30 minute progress meeting.
The first 10 minutes of the meeting will be
for folks to make a single slide
highlighting their progress from this week.
You should also make another slide with a
screenshot of our shared project notes doc
with the goal and agenda for our upcoming
Monday project meeting
(this means the agenda has to already be in
our shared doc before the Friday Progress meeting!).
The next 20 minutes of the meeting will be
for us all to go through the slides together
and hear what everyone has been up to.</p>
<p>For your progress meeting presentation slides,
remember that <em>you have an audience</em>.
Part of the goal of this meeting is for us all to
better understand what everyone is up to,
that way we can better support and encourage each other.
You will never have enough time in one week for folks to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>
what you’re up to,
but week-over-week the big picture should start to gel,
especially when paired with occasional PLSE Talks etc.</p>
<p>For the progress meeting,
you should already have the
agenda for the next Monday project
prepared before 15:00, and
and it should be written out in
our project meeting notes doc.
You are encouraged to also prepare your
personal progress slide before the meeting,
but it is 100% OK to make it during the
first 10 minutes of the progress meeting;
that is why that time is reserved.
We will make a fresh deck each week in
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-XSIQ6wM7oS3mA1kKcGmECbtAV1223nW">this shared folder</a>.</p>
<p>At 15:30 we will have PL Reading Group (PLRG)
to end the week with a lively discussion.
Please check out the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MArKA-kehiYP4ITnPBX10-z9Wz5R92UOu75hpPD2kMM/edit?usp=sharing">PLRG Principles</a>

<section id="Quarterly-Cadence">
<h3>Quarterly Cadence</h3>
<p>The quarter system is short and intense.
On week 11,
we will cancel all regular meetings and
push hard to wrap up our quarter goals.
On week 12,
we will cancel all regular meetings,
rest, and plan out the next quarter.</p>

<h2>Regular Meeting Structure</h2>
<p>Structuring frequent tasks is useful because
it frees up thinking and emotional energy
for other tasks.
Below is a default meeting formula
we can adapt as our team and projects evolve.</p>

<section id="Meeting-Preparation">
<h3>Meeting Preparation</h3>
<p>Every meeting should have a concrete, specific goal
written out explicitly in the meeting doc.
Think “meeting in a sentence”.
Everyone should know
the goal a day (or more) before the meeting.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of
a simple and perfectly good meeting agenda:</p>
<blockquote class="green">
<p>2023-05-15</p>
<p>Draft pseudocode for main algorithm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example of
a more detailed, but
also good meeting agenda
(though maybe too ambitious):</p>
<blockquote class="green">
<p>2023-05-15</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Settle on operators for first DSL prototype</p>
<ul>
<li>
Discuss tradeoffs for restricting only to affine cases
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: easier to get end-to-end prototype working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: other components might overfit to these cases</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Agree on specs for each operator
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick three example benchmarks to implement this week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debug performance regression from nightly eval run last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See logs here (link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devise strategy to reproduce</p>
<ul>
<li>
Not observing this on my laptop or in CI
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Good agendas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Concise</strong>.
Folks can quickly determine how to prepare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple</strong>.
Folks can easily determine what’s needed
for the meeting to accomplish its goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Realistic</strong>.
The goal is achievable
within the allotted meeting time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritized</strong>.
The goal advances the most important project tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, here is an example of
a <strong class="red">BAD</strong> meeting agenda:</p>
<blockquote class="red">
<p>2023-05-15</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make plans</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="Running-Project-Meetings">
<h3>Running Project Meetings</h3>
<p>Start on time and
stay on track
to accomplish the goal
before the meeting ends.
This can be very tricky
when each cool idea sparks
three more cool ideas.
Just jot such ideas down;
we will explore them
in the lab together after the meeting.</p>
<p>Keep updates short.
Ideally updates will largely happen in
one-on-one advisor meetings,
progress meetings, and
opportunistically in the lab.
Most meetings will still need to begin
with a few minutes of updates
to get everyone synced.
Watch for any updates that
should modify the meeting goal
and be ready to adapt.</p>
<p>Ensure everyone participates.
This can also be very tricky.
I will do my best to watch for
any issues and help handle them early.
If you notice an issue that isn’t being handled,
please put it on our one-on-one agenda or
schedule a one-off to discuss.</p>
<p>Reserve enough time to wrap up
with concrete tasks for the week.
Think “What do I want to say
I accomplished by this Friday?”</p>
</section>
<section id="Running-Advisor-Meetings">
<h3>Running Advisor Meetings</h3>
<p>One-on-one advisor meetings
are for regularly checking in on
how you are doing,
long-term (post-PhD) goals,
timing for TAing and internships,
etc.
We should work on
whatever is most important for your
happiness and long-term success.
That can also mean covering the
same sort of topics as project meetings.
If you are mentoring another student,
we should always make time to
briefly check in on their progress as well.</p>
<p>Like project meetings,
it’s often helpful for
our one-on-one meetings
to have an explicit goal.
Unlike project meetings,
we should usually still meet
even if there is no explicit goal.
Checking in and making sure
things are going well
is always a good goal
for one-on-one meetings.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="But-Why">
<h2>But… Why?</h2>
<p>Folks can do roughly four hours of
challenging technical work on
their main project each day.
Since “peak working hours” are precious,
planning how to make the most of them
is an excellent investment.
Having explicit structure
frees up time and energy
for more interesting work and
helps manage expectations for
everyone in the group.</p>
<p>We have myriad other responsibilities
on top of research.
The challenge is that
<em>all these other things are important too</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
course work
</li>
<li>
group lunch
</li>
<li>
reading group
</li>
<li>
department colloquia
</li>
<li>
mentoring junior students
</li>
<li>
volunteering for department service
</li>
<li>
socializing at PoCSci, TGIF, Friday Breakfast
</li>
<li>
etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>These all help support “the point” of a PhD,
i.e., developing the skills needed to conduct original research,
but they often contribute somewhat less directly than
just actually doing research.
Avoid the trap of
<a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/326713/meaning-of-the-phrase-death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts">death by 1,000 papercuts</a>.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to get lost among our many obligations
and procrastinate on the
challenging, important tasks
that push our research forward.
Pulling “stunts” to cram a week’s worth of
work in before our next meeting or
attempting back-to-back all nighters
for a deadline is <strong>very bad</strong>.
Not only does it lead to lower quality work,
but it will destroy your health over time,
both physically and mentally.
It is much better to establish and maintain a
steady, sustainable <a href="basic-advice.html">routine</a>.</p>
<p>Having too many meetings is a trap.
If we are so busy we can’t
prepare for or be fully present during a meeting,
then the meeting just
drains energy and eats into
the good working hours
it was supposed to support!
It is better to just cancel such meetings and
get caught up instead.
Of course, the best practice is to
never get so overcommitted
in the first place.</p>
<p>Hopefully the ideas in
this document will help.
Of course, this is all just a big experiment.
Please message me if you have any suggestions<a id="fnref2" href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
We will try it out, iterate, and adapt as we learn!</p>
