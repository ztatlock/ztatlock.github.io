# [Zachary Tatlock][] / Build the Simplest Thing First

Some reviewers find complexity irresistible.
Maybe
  they conflate complexity with significance or
  they fear looking ignorant.
Whatever the reason,
  this unfortunate tendency
  biases authors away from asking
  the simplest questions first and
  instead pushes them toward
  unnecessary complexity.
It is a terrible trap.

You should always build
  "the simplest thing that could possibly work"
  as a first baseline solution
  because it is the Right Thing™️ to do.
Building and evaluating
  the simplest possible baseline
  provides many benefits:

- You get a basic prototype set up quickly
- You get some ballpark performance numbers
- You can ground early lemmas in concrete examples
- You are incentivized to start collecting more benchmarks
- You can start developing "push-button evaluation" scripts early
- You get a maximally simple model to help on-board junior team members

However, the biggest benefit is that
  you reduce the risk of fooling
  yourself and the research community.

Several of my favorite projects were inspired
  during reading group discussions.
Some new technique would seem overly complex,
  so we would look through the paper to see
  how it compared against the
  most simple, obvious, naive baseline.
But the authors almost never bothered
  to even build or run such a baseline!
Instead,
  they would provide some hand wavy argument about
  how it "obviously could never work".

It turns out that the simplest baseline
  works much more often and much better
  than folks expect.
Furthermore,
  if you can rustle up some meaningful benchmarks,
  build the simplest version of a system,
  and then look at profiling data from actually running it,
  you will very often come up with novel insights.
The
  [Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/),
  [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), and
  [Ruler](https://github.com/uwplse/ruler) projects
  all started by following this recipe
  (all won Distinguished Paper awards, not a coincidence).

So, if we are in a meeting and someone
  asks how well an extremely naive approach would do,
  don't hand wave some argument about
  how it "obviously could never work".
Thank them for reminding us to do the
  simplest thing first, and then go do it.
The results will almost always surprise you.

  - _"Jugaad refers to an innovative fix or a simple work-around,
      a solution that bends the rules, or
      a resource that can be used in such a way.
    It is also often used to signify creativity:
      to make existing things work,
      or to create new things with meager resources."_

- [System D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_D)

  - _"System D is a manner of responding to challenges that
      require one to have the ability to
      think quickly, to adapt, and
      to improvise when getting a job done.
    \ ...
    \ The term is a direct translation of French Système D.
    The letter D refers to any one of the French nouns
      débrouille, débrouillardise, or démerde (French slang).
    The verbs se débrouiller and se démerder
      mean to make do, to manage,
      especially in an adverse situation.
    Basically, it refers to one's ability and need to be resourceful."_
