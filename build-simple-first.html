<p>Some reviewers find complexity irresistible.
Maybe
they conflate complexity with significance or
they fear looking ignorant.
Whatever the reason,
this unfortunate tendency
biases authors away from asking
the simplest questions first and
instead pushes them toward
unnecessary complexity.
It is a terrible trap.</p>
<p>You should always build
“the simplest thing that could possibly work”
as a first baseline solution
because it is the Right Thing™️ to do.
Building and evaluating
the simplest possible baseline
provides many benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You get a basic prototype set up quickly
</li>
<li>
You get some ballpark performance numbers
</li>
<li>
You can ground early lemmas in concrete examples
</li>
<li>
You are incentivized to start collecting more benchmarks
</li>
<li>
You can start developing “push-button evaluation” scripts early
</li>
<li>
You get a maximally simple model to help on-board junior team members
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the biggest benefit is that
you reduce the risk of fooling
yourself and the research community.</p>
<p>Several of my favorite projects were inspired
during reading group discussions.
Some new technique would seem overly complex,
so we would look through the paper to see
how it compared against the
most simple, obvious, naive baseline.
But the authors almost never bothered
to even build or run such a baseline!
Instead,
they would provide some hand wavy argument about
how it “obviously could never work”.</p>
<p>It turns out that the simplest baseline
works much more often and much better
than folks expect.
Furthermore,
if you can rustle up some meaningful benchmarks,
build the simplest version of a system,
and then look at profiling data from actually running it,
you will very often come up with novel insights.
The
<a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org/">Herbie</a>,
<a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io/">egg</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/uwplse/ruler">Ruler</a> projects
all started by following this recipe
(all won Distinguished Paper awards, not a coincidence).</p>
<p>So, if we are in a meeting and someone
asks how well an extremely naive approach would do,
don’t hand wave some argument about
how it “obviously could never work”.
Thank them for reminding us to do the
simplest thing first, and then go do it.
The results will almost always surprise you.</p>
